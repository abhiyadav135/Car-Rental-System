Overview
The Car Rental System is a conceptual project designed to simulate a basic car rental service using Python.
This project aims to implement a system where customers can register, rent cars, and view their rental history.
It will incorporate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and scalability, as well as file handling to achieve data persistence.

Planned Features
User Registration & Management: The system will allow new customers to register with a unique ID, name, and license number.
This feature will manage customer data and provide each customer with a rental history.
Car Inventory Management: A feature to add and manage car listings, including details like make, model, year, and rental price per day.
Cars will also have an availability status to indicate if they are currently rented.
Rental & Return Functionality: Registered customers will be able to rent available cars for a specified period, with the rental cost calculated based on the daily rate and rental duration. 
Returning cars will update the availability status and record the transaction in the customerâ€™s rental history.
Rental History: Each customer will have a rental history that logs previously rented cars, rental durations, and total costs.
This history will be viewable to customers as a summary of their past transactions.
Data Persistence: The system will use file handling to store and retrieve data, ensuring that car and customer information remains intact even when the application is closed.
Proposed Project Structure
Object-Oriented Design: The project will use classes like Car, Customer, Rental, and RentalSystem to organize related functionality, encapsulating attributes and methods within each class.
File Handling: Data will be stored in text files (cars.txt and customers.txt), allowing the system to save and load customer and car data between sessions.
Each file will follow a simple, readable format for easy data management.
Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Core Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and File Handling for data storage
Conclusion
This Car Rental System concept will demonstrate how OOP and file handling in Python can be applied to develop a functional rental service. 
The system will emphasize code organization and data persistence, aiming to deliver an efficient, easy-to-use solution for managing car rentals.
